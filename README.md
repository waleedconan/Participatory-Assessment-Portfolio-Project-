# 📘 Participatory Assessment Dashboard – README

## 🧩 Project Overview
This dashboard was developed as a simulated participatory assessment tool focused on key protection concerns in humanitarian settings. The data represents fictional responses from 300 community members disaggregated by Age, Gender, and Diversity (AGD), and analyzed across four sectors:
- **Child Protection (CP)**
- **Gender-Based Violence (GBV)**
- **Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene (WASH)**
- **Shelter & Site Conditions**

## 🎯 Objective
To demonstrate the use of data visualization tools like Power BI in interpreting participatory assessment findings, particularly for:
- Donor reporting
- Field-level coordination
- Protection and program planning

## 🗂️ Data Structure
- **Format**: Wide-format Excel table
- **Rows**: Each row represents one respondent
- **Columns**: Each column is a question related to one of the sectors (CP, GBV, WASH, Shelter)
- **Disaggregation**: Group (e.g. Girls, Boys, Women, PwD), Age Group, State

## 🔍 Methodology
- Responses were **simulated** using randomized values with logic-driven skip patterns (e.g., only women and girls answered GBV safety questions).
- Questions were aligned with **standard AGD-sensitive participatory tools** used by protection actors in the field.
- Charts and visuals were built using **Power BI**, including filters by group and state.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
- This project was developed **independently for learning and portfolio purposes**.
- It uses **entirely fictional data** and does not reflect any real individuals, organizations, or operational context.
- No internal reports, confidential data, or proprietary formats were used.
- This work is **not affiliated with or endorsed by UNHCR or any other agency**.
- Sector concepts (e.g., CFS, CCPNs, dignity kits) are based on general humanitarian practice and public knowledge.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
- 4 Pages: **Demographics, Child Protection, GBV, WASH & Shelter**
- Slicers for **State** and **AGD Groups**
- Counts and proportions of key indicators
- Visuals include bar charts, stacked columns, pie charts, and summary cards
