üìù **Project Summary**

As part of the Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) approach, the Protection Sector initiated an annual participatory assessment to ensure that the perspectives of crisis-affected individuals directly inform protection planning and response efforts.

This assessment aimed to:

- Promote meaningful community engagement

- Ensure that community members contribute actively to designing protection strategies and interventions

üìä **Methodology**

> The dataset used in this project is entirely fictional and created solely for learning and demonstration purposes.

### Data Collection Approach
A total of **300 focus group discussions (FGDs)** were conducted across **seven states**, engaging approximately **3,000 participants** from diverse population segments:
- Women (18‚Äì59)  
- Men (18‚Äì59)  
- Adolescent girls (12‚Äì17)  
- Adolescent boys (12‚Äì17)  
- Older persons (60+)  
- Persons with disabilities (PwDs)

### Process & Tools Used
Discussions were facilitated by trained staff from different agencies and NGOs, who compiled and reviewed data daily to ensure consistency and quality.

The five-day data collection effort was conducted simultaneously across locations to maximize reach.

For simulation purposes:
- KoBoToolbox was used for data collection. ChatGPT provided technical support in designing the form and logic using simulated (fictional) data for demonstration purposes.

- **Excel** was used for data cleaning  
- **Power BI** was used for data preparation, analysis, and dashboard creation  

üìà Key Findings
