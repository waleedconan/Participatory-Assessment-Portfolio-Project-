# ðŸ“˜ Participatory Assessment â€“ Portfolio Project

## Project Objective
To amplify the voices of affected communities through a multisector participatory assessment, thereby informing more targeted and effective humanitarian responses by enabling a deeper understanding of their needs, concerns, and priorities across key humanitarian sectors.

---

## Project Summary
As part of the Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) approach, the Protection Sector initiated an annual participatory assessment to ensure that the voices of affected communities meaningfully inform protection planning and response. This exercise aimed to promote community engagement, identify protection risks and gaps, and ensure that beneficiaries are active contributors to the development of protection strategies and interventions.

## Methodology
- The data presented in this project are entirely fictional and were created solely for demonstration and learning purposes.
- Data was collected through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) conducted in three states: Blue Nile, Gedaref, and North Darfur.
- The assessment engaged 15 focus groups, reaching a total of 180 participants across various population groups.
- Participants were segmented based on age, gender, and diversity, including:
* Women (18â€“59)
* Men (18â€“59)
* Adolescent girls (12â€“17)
* Adolescent boys (12â€“17)
* Older persons (60+)
* Persons with disabilities (PwDs)
- Group facilitators led the discussions and compiled the data at the end of each day. They were also responsible for ensuring the quality and consistency of the collected data.
- The data collection process was completed over a five-day period, with teams covering different locations simultaneously to optimize coverage.
- For simulation purposes, KoBoToolbox was used to design the assessment form, Excel for data cleaning and preparation, and Power BI for analysis and dashboard visualization. **Please note: The Power BI dashboard is currently under development and will be added soon.**
