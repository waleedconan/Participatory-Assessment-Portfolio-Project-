üìù **Project Summary**

As part of the Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP) approach, the Protection Sector initiated an annual participatory assessment to ensure that the perspectives of crisis-affected individuals directly inform protection planning and response efforts.

This assessment aimed to:

- Promote meaningful community engagement  
- Identify protection risks, gaps, and service needs  
- Ensure that community members contribute actively to designing protection strategies and interventions

üìä **Methodology**

> The dataset used in this project is entirely fictional and created solely for learning and demonstration purposes.

### Data Collection Approach
Data was collected through Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) in three states:
- Blue Nile  
- Gedaref  
- North Darfur  

A total of 15 focus groups were conducted, engaging 180 participants from diverse population segments:
- Women (18‚Äì59)  
- Men (18‚Äì59)  
- Adolescent girls (12‚Äì17)  
- Adolescent boys (12‚Äì17)  
- Older persons (60+)  
- Persons with disabilities (PwDs)

### Process & Tools Used
Discussions were facilitated by trained staff, who compiled and reviewed data daily to ensure consistency and quality.

The five-day data collection effort was conducted simultaneously across locations to maximize reach.

For simulation purposes:
- **KoBoToolbox** was used to design the assessment tool  
- **Excel** was used for data cleaning and preparation  
- **Power BI** was used for data analysis and dashboard creation  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Power BI dashboard is currently under development and will be added soon.
