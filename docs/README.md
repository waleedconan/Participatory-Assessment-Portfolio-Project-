## 🎯 Project Objective

To amplify the voices of affected communities through a multisector participatory assessment, enabling more targeted and effective humanitarian responses by deepening the understanding of community needs, concerns, and priorities across key sectors.

---

## 📝 Project Summary

As part of the **Accountability to Affected Populations (AAP)** approach, the Protection Sector initiated an annual participatory assessment to ensure that the perspectives of crisis-affected individuals directly inform protection planning and response efforts.

This assessment aimed to:

- Promote meaningful community engagement  
- Identify protection risks, service gaps, and urgent needs  
- Ensure that community members contribute actively to designing protection strategies and interventions

## 📊 Methodology

> ℹ️ The dataset used in this project is entirely fictional and created solely for learning and demonstration purposes.

### 📍 Data Collection Approach

A total of **300 focus group discussions (FGDs)** were conducted across **seven states**, engaging approximately **3,000 participants** from diverse population segments:

- Women (18–59)  
- Men (18–59)  
- Adolescent girls (12–17)  
- Adolescent boys (12–17)  
- Older persons (60+)  
- Persons with disabilities (PwDs)

### 🧰 Process & Tools Used

- FGDs were facilitated by trained staff from different agencies and NGOs.  
- Field teams reviewed and compiled data daily to ensure accuracy and consistency.  
- The five-day data collection effort was conducted simultaneously across locations for better coverage.

For simulation and portfolio purposes:

- **KoBoToolbox** was used to design the form and simulate data collection.  
- **ChatGPT** provided support in building the XLSForm with skip logic tailored to age, gender, and disability.  
- **Excel** was used for cleaning and formatting raw responses.  
- **Power BI** was used for data preparation, visual analysis, and dashboard creation.

## 📊 Dashboard Interpretation

### 🔹 Demographic Overview  
![Demographic Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waleedconan/Participatory-Assessment-Portfolio-Project-/main/visuals/Demographic.png)

The chart shows that the **majority of FGD participants were children aged 12–17**, with **90 participants**, followed by **older persons (60+)** and **adults aged 25–59** (78 participants). Youth participation was the lowest among all age groups.

The assessment took place across **seven states**, with the **highest number of FGDs in Gedaref and Red Sea (50 each)**, followed by **Kassala and Northern (45 each)**. 

**PwDs** were the **second most represented group**, while **girls and women had the lowest participation**, indicating a need for deeper analysis into participation barriers.

---

### 🔹 Child Protection Indicators  
![Child Protection Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waleedconan/Participatory-Assessment-Portfolio-Project-/main/visuals/Child_Protection.png)

The chart reveals a significant service gap: **only 16 functioning Child-Friendly Spaces (CFSs)** across assessed locations currently meet the **Child Protection Minimum Standards (CPMS)**.

This shortfall is particularly alarming in **White Nile**, which hosts approximately **150,000 children** but lacks sufficient CP-compliant CFS coverage.

In **Kassala State**, although 19 protection desks are functioning, they serve over **50,000 children**, indicating a gap in dedicated child protection support structures. These findings point to an urgent need for **investment in both CFS infrastructure and community-based child protection mechanisms** to promote children's safety, psychosocial well-being, and access to services.

---

### 🔹 Gender-Based Violence (GBV)  
![GBV Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waleedconan/Participatory-Assessment-Portfolio-Project-/main/visuals/GBV.png)

**Blue Nile** had the **highest reported perception of safety at night** among women and girls—a positive outlier that should be further studied to identify best practices.

Meanwhile, **White Nile and Blue Nile** recorded **low levels of women’s participation in community decision-making** and **limited availability of GBV services**. These gaps require targeted investigation and programming.

---

### 🔹 WASH and Shelter  
![WASH and Shelter Dashboard](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/waleedconan/Participatory-Assessment-Portfolio-Project-/main/visuals/WASH_and_Shelters.png)

In **White Nile**, latrines suitable for persons with disabilities were reported as **severely limited**, despite the state hosting Sudan’s largest refugee population—highlighting a critical need for inclusive WASH services.

In **Blue Nile**, community members reported **widespread shelter inadequacy**. With the rainy season approaching, **urgent interventions** are needed to mitigate health and protection risks.

## 📌 Key Findings & Recommendations

| **Thematic Area**            | **Key Findings**                                                                                   | **Recommended Actions**                                                                                  |
|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Demographic Inclusion**    | Children (12–17) were the majority of participants; women and girls had the lowest participation.  | Review outreach strategies to ensure AGD balance; explore barriers to female participation.              |
| **Child Protection – CFS Gap (White Nile)** | Only 16 functioning CFSs meet CP standards, despite White Nile hosting ~150,000 children. | Scale up CP-compliant CFSs in high-need states. Improve quality and monitoring of existing facilities. |
| **Child Protection – Protection Desk Gap (Kassala)** | Kassala has only 19 protection desks serving 50,000+ children, with limited CP service coverage. | Expand child protection presence through protection desks, mobile outreach, and caseworker deployment. |
| **GBV – Safety Perception**  | Blue Nile had the highest safety-at-night perception among women and girls.                        | Analyze contributing factors and replicate best practices in other states.                                |
| **GBV – Participation & Services** | White Nile and Blue Nile reported low female participation and limited GBV services.               | Investigate causes and scale up GBV services; strengthen community engagement for women.                  |
| **WASH – PwD Accessibility** | White Nile lacks accessible latrines for persons with disabilities.                                | Improve inclusive WASH infrastructure and prioritize disability-friendly designs.                         |
| **Shelter Conditions**       | Blue Nile reported major shelter gaps with the rainy season approaching.                           | Deploy emergency shelter support and upgrade shelter solutions in advance of seasonal risks.              |
